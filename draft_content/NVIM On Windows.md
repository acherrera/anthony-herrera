# NVIM On Windows

This is something that I've been struggling with for a very long time. I am a fairly advanced user of NVIM on Ubuntu however I've never quite gotten a good workflow working with windows. 

After starting with a fresh windows install, I figured it would be as good of a time as any to really crack this problem open. In order to do that I only have NVIM as my text editor and will be updating it as required.
