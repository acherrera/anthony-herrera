# Documentation Systems

### TLDR 

Four parts of documentation: 
- tutorials
- how-to guides
- technical reference 
- explanation


## Notes

### Tutorials


Show steps to complete something. Learning oriented. This is the first stop for most users
NOT a manual for best practices
The effect of every action should be visible and evident as soon as possible, and the connection to the action should be clear

### How To Guides

Directions for specify end, complete goal oriented. 
A how-to guide is an answer to a question that only a user with some experience could even formulate.

### Reference

Description of the code base. That's it. No discussion or extensive instruction on how to use it. Think of an encyclopedia entry for an ingredient in a recipe
Features:
- Same structure as code
- Consistent writing
- Only describe. Link how to info if relevant
- Accurate and up to date

### Explanation

Discussion / commentary about the code. Deepens knowledge of the area without necessarily being applicable to the code. 
Features:
- Provide Context: historical, decisions, technical
- Alternatives and options: deployment methods, test structure, etc
- No instructions or technical reference

### Conclusion

Many projects use the above system for keeping track of for the system works. See the website above for links or just keep an eye out for the four steps
