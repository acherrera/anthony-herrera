This is the basis for the start of the note taking journey. Though originally this was done on Evernote, it has moved over to Obsidian. The idea here is very similar to [[Getting Things Done (Method)]]. Keep everything you might need and turn it into useful knowledge.

This starts with CODE - how we remember the steps to be taken. 
# CODE
Capture, Organize, Distill, Express. These are the steps that are use to turn information into action.

* Capture. Keep if it is:
	* Useful
	* Interesting
	* Inspiring
	* Surprising
* Organize. Organize into
	* Projects
	* Areas
	* Resources
	* Archive
* Distill
	* Supposedly, should highlight the main points of captured notes.
	* After highlighting, can summarize the note in your own words
*  Express
	* This ultimately the long term goal of this system - take notes well enough that they can be use in the future for other things.
	* If you follow the other steps well, this should just happen.
