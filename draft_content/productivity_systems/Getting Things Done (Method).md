# Getting Things Done
Method to keep track of everything that needs to be done. 


## Steps:
* Capture: write down everything on your mind
* Clarify: Process all tasks and determine what to do about them
* Organize: Sort through tasks and put them in appropriate places
* Reflect: Review list daily and weekly.
* Engage: Do the most important items first.

This is very similar to what is shown in the [[Building a Second Brain]] book, with an additional step.
