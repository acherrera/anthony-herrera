# Distill

There's a lot to distill here and not a lot of fluff. Very good.

* Declare bankruptcy on your memory
	* You don't remember things for long. Write it down and keep it
* Carry a notebook. 
	* Write important things down. 
* Active Externalism
	* Theory that transfers memory from inside brain to outside
* Calendars 
	* Use them. Put events in there.
* Getting Things Done (GTD)
	* David Allen's GTD. See: https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done
	* And this: https://gettingthingsdone.com/
		* Gross, culty
	* Capture, Clarify, Organize, Review, Engage.
	* Similar to CODE: Capture Organize, Distill, Engage. 
* Earplugs
	* Block out noise because noise causes sensory overload
* In ambiguity, refuse temptation to guess
	* If you don't understand someone, have them repeat themselves.
	* Note terribly useful
* Use a note taking system. 
	* Good job.
* Plain Text Lasts Forever.
	* Obsidian has everything in one place. 
	* Evernote is painful to pry out of the website.
* Do the hard / least pleasant task first.
	* "Eat the frog" gross
* Build Habits then chain them together
	* Read / Summarize Triggers by Marshall Goldsmith
	* Basically, do small things often and create a big impact.
* Public speaking is important.
	* Do this.
* Imitate others
* Negative emotions are not very useful.
	* Practice this. Notice the negative emotions, but feel the positives.
* Focus.
	* Pick something and focus on it. Don't doom scroll everything. That is a waste of time.
* Just do a bit.
	* One word after another creates a book.
* Timers are great.
	* Pomodoro technique
		* 20 minutes on, 5 minutes off. 
		* Do this over and over and over and over.
* Humanize - Organize - Mechanize.
	* Humanize: do things manually and iterate
	* Organize: Notice the patterns happening
	* Mechanize: Automate those pattern.s: Checklists, flowchart or software.
* One thing at a time. Most Important thing first.
