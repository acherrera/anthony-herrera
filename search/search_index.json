Somehow, Specialized still doesn't have a reliable or easy-to-rebuild rear shock for the Specialized Epic. </p> <p>Gen 1 shock - You can either replace it with a new shock or you can't. There are two models of rear shock, and they had not yet created a proprietary shock, so it's a drop-in replacement if you have the right model. The model that had the Fox shock cannot be replaced like this.</p> <p>Gen 2 - This magical piece of equipment is the key to all your dreams. </p> <p>And can be found here</p> <p>This is an adapter for the Gen 2 Specialized Epic that allows a normal shock to be used in place of the proprietary one that comes stock with the bike. Does it work? Yes. Does it make your bike heavier? No, not really. Is it expensive? About as much as a single rebuild.</p> <p>Gen 3 - The people at Bike Yoke promised that they would create a new Yoke for the Gen 3 model and even showcased a version of it. However, it has not come to the market yet, and I eagerly await the sale of the adapter.</p> <p>Proof that a prototype has been made:  </p> <p>Originally found here</p>"},{"location":"other/Specialized%20Epic%20Brain/#specializeds-response","title":"Specialized's Response","text":"<p>It's been mainly crickets. They don't produce an official adapter, and the rebuilds don't seem to last significantly longer than the original.  They've created a few different versions of the shock, so they are at least trying to improve.  Given the number of people I personally know who have had issues with this shock, I'm a little surprised I haven't seen more about it.  Perhaps it's just that rough Iowa mountain biking (joking, of course).</p> <p>Specialized has started to remove the brain from their bikes - The Specialized Epic is a great example of this exact thing.  With the introduction of their Epic World Cup (Not a Trek SuperCaliber), they may be looking at phasing out the Specialized Epic Brain altogether.  This seems like it would be great for everyone. The Epic World Cup might have a proprietary rear shock, but it's at least a new proprietary shock,  and maybe, just maybe, we'll be able to rebuild it in our basements.</p> <p>In the end, it seems they created a high-performance, low-reliability shock and sold it to the public, who are often looking for a medium-performance, high-reliability shock that is easy to rebuild. People can't afford to rebuild their bikes every 50 miles,  yet they're stuck with a very, very nice bike that requires exactly that.
