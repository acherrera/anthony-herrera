# Dirt Trail Maintenance

One thing I enjoy doing during the summer is maintenance of dirt trails for mountain biking. 
This started as giving back to the trails that I ride and has become somewhat of a passion. 
The micro power tool selection is interesting and evolving very quickly with the improvements in battery technology. As such, it's possible to maintain trails in way that would have been prohibitively difficult a decade ago.
For example, with electric chainsaw, you can put them in a backpack and not worry about hot exhaust or leaking fluid.
