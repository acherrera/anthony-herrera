# Walk Behind Brush Mowers

## Introduction

Examples of walk behind brush mowers include the DR Field and Brush Mower, Billy Goat Outback Brush Cutter. 
These machines are designed to cut through thick brush and tall grass.

When used for trail maintenance however, they can be hard to maneuver in tight spaces and may not be suitable for steep slopes.
They are also far too large for the average person to bring deep into the woods, so their use is limited to areas that are easily accessible by vehicle.

## Large Complex and Heavy

One of the tenants of my trail maintenance is to keep things simple and light. The DR Power mower features:

* A 26" cutting width
* 3 forward speeds and 1 reverse
* 14.5 HP engine
* locking differential
* differential braking
* electric start

These features make the brush mower an absolute powerhouse for long stretches of flat or gently sloping terrain.
However, the mower is heavy and difficult to maneuver in tight spaces. In addition, when these mowers break, they are very difficult to drag out of the woods for repair. I know, I've had to do it.

## Conclusion

While that is a lot of negatives, the brush mowers are a ton of fun to operate.
If you did not have to walk behind them, they would probably be one of the better tools for trail maintenance.
However, the weight and complexity of the machines make them less than ideal for individuals doing trail maintenance. 
Certainly not a tool I would recommend going out and purchasing for the average user.
