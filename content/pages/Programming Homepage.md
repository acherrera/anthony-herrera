# Programming

I do a lot of programming related things. AWS, Python, to creating the website that this is hosted on. My hope is that  I can create a centralized location for these things.

[[Obsidian-Pelican Setup]] : How this website is created and ran. 

[[AWS CLI Install]] : Basic note on how to get AWS CLI.

[[Keychron K2 Keyboard Review]] : The keyboard that I use and love.

[[Fish Remove Bookmarks Manually]] : Weird niche error that can occur with link and the fish terminal.
