# Recipes

These are things that I like to make and I keep them on here so that I can share them others and access them myself when needed.

I try to keep comments to very relevant aspects of the recipe. If you would like an essay on butter chicken, look elsewhere.

# Instant Pot

Things that can be made in an instant Pot.

[[Chili]]: Meaty, thick and good.

[[Vegetarian Chili]]: Very good vegetarian chili.

[[Spaghetti Squash]]: Noodles. From a squash.

[[Butternut Squash Soup]]: Quick easy and good soup.

[[Butter Chicken]]: Chicken and butter. 

[[Healthy Chicken Tikka Masala]]: Chicken Tikka Masala recipe. Pretty good. Less butter based than traditional Tikka Masala

[[Paneer Veggie Tikka Masala]] : Based on [[Healthy Chicken Tikka Masala]]

[[Pulled Pork]] : Quick and easy way to turn a lot of pork into food for the week.

[[Chicken Vindaloo]] - Spicy Indian Dish

# Misc

Other things that don't have a category
