# Garmin ForeRunner 245 Review

This is a review of the Garmin Forerunner 245 - a watch made by Garmin and this watch is built for one thing - recording
activities and lasting for a LONG time. My wife originally purchased this watch and I liked it so much I got my own. 


## Things I like

* Battery lasts for many days
* Integration into Garmin Connect (and through this, most other apps)
* Ability to view text message and do simple responses
* Heart rate, breathing, O2, sleep quality measurements
