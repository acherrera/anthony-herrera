Summary: Getting Started with Python Pelican

# Python and Pelican

I like the idea of having a website and have built out quite a few using WordPress and
AWS EC2 services. I've built a test website or two from scratch in Python but they have
always felt very "heavy". I just want to create a few reviews and updates, maybe do some
Google Analytics. A static website is a good place to start, but then there is
styles that have to be set up. I'd like some kind of framework.... Enter Pelican!

A module to create a static website from scratch. No databases, no users, just serve up some HTML and maybe some images and call it good. Reasons I'm choosing to go this way:

## Things I like

* Simple
* Cheap (no databases, just store the files)
* Easy - single line updates
* "from scratch" - no services to sign up for, just write, build and deploy
* Nice organization - menu items added based on Categories
* Github storage - I like Github

## Things That Are Lacking

* E-commerce tools - what do I need these for?
* User sign up and comments - what do I need these for?
* Per user customization - I'm not creating Facebook here, just putting some thoughts and ideas up
* User counter displayed on page (would be nice)
