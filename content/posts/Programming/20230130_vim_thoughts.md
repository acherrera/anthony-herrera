Summary: Thoughts on using VIM


# VIM

Vim is such an interesting tool in the year 2023. It was originally created in the 70's or 
something for people who were using mainframe computers. Surely there are have been better tools 
created in the previous 50 year - and there is. VIM is also very difficult to use, being a modal 
editor that doesn't use the mouse at all. It's not very intuitive and doesn't look that great by default. So, why use it?
