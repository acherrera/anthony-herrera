# Bike Commuting Guidelines

This is something that I have been considering putting together for a few years now. I've gone
through several iterations of it along with bike commuting for many stretches of time. The purpose
of this is to serve as a reference sheet for bike commuting in general.

## What Bike To Use

I have owned many different types of bikes and have commuted on many of them through different times
of the year. I will say that the BEST bike I have commuted with is an ebike with a belt drive and an
internal hub. No maintenance and you don't even have to pedal very much if you don't want.

Any bike can be used as a commuter bike. It does require a little bit of planning regardless of the
bike that is being used. I would recommend having a dedicated commuter that you also use for other
activities as opposed to an activity bike that you commute with. Reason being, if you are riding a
bike every day, you want it to be ready to go and good every day. Now, that being said, a slightly
"beefier" bike is going to be better. Hybrid bike and commuter bikes are more upright and comfortable
than race focused bike. However, the a gravel bike, mountain bike and road bike will all work. Bigger
tires will work better in snowy weather and varying terrain than smaller tires.

* Hybrid bikes - very good option, though may need to watch out for lower quality bikes.
* Mountain bikes - good all weather option, though often lack mount points for racks.
* Gravel bikes - decent all weather option, but often lack mount points for racks.
* Road bike - my least favorite option unless you are trying to be as fast as possible.

## Bike Gear

Fenders and a bike bag make commuting much easier. Fenders ensure that water and debris is not thrown
onto you while riding. This may make it so that you can wear work clothes while commuting as they will
not get nearly as dirty and wet. The other very useful item is a bike bag of some kind. Weather this
is a rack with a trunk or a panniers, either one will work. The purpose of these are to store clothing 
and item that make commuting much nicer. Depending on your job, you may want to bring items to work in 
a backpack. If you don't need to bing a backpack to work, a backpack will work to bring commuting item.


## Temperature

Temperature and weather is the hardest part of bike commuting. This depends on your location, but in the
midwest, it might be 24 degrees in the morning and 54 degrees in the afternoon. This requires gloves, two
coats, some overpants and maybe a face covering in the morning and just a light coat in the afternoon.
Because of this, the bike storage mentioned above will come in handy for storage of items and transport.

It's difficult to tell exactly what should be worn, but there are few guidelines. Primarily, layering
will be your friend. This is because if you don't judge the temperature correctly, you can make adjustments
and the multiple layers help trap heat better than a single thick layer. Here is the clothing that I wear
while commuting in temperature between 25 and 60 degrees.

Warm gear:
* Light under gloves
* Light coat
* Ear warmer head band

Cold gear:
* Long sleeved under shirt
* Full face head covering
* Rain proof pants
* Heavy gloves to go over the light gloves.

In the above examples, the the "warm" gears is temporarily used in tempearatures between about 45 and 60.
The "Cold gear" is used in tempearatures between 25 and 45 in addition to the items listed in the warm 
gear section.

## Weather

Weather can drastically change how the affect of temperature on you. The difference between sunny and no wind
vs overcast and windy can be rather drastic. In addition, when commuting in below freezing temperatures, it is
important to consider potential road conditions. There have been many times when I've elected to drive instead
of bike because the conditions of the concrete was poor or because the weather made the temperature feel 
unacceptably cold. That's okay.

## Conclusion

Bike commuting can be a lot of fun, add a bit of variety to your day and save the environment (well, it's at
least a bit better than driving probably). I like doing it as it helps differentiate the days and get you
a little in touch in nature. It's a skill to know what to wear in various temperatures and weather conditions, 
but when you get it right it's a good day.
