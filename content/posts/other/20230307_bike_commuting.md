# Bike Commuting Guidelines

This is something that I have been considering putting together for a few years now. I've gone
through several iterations of it along with bike commuting for many stretches of time. The purpose
of this is to serve as a reference sheet for bike commuting in general.

## What Bike To Use

I have owned many different types of bikes and have commuted on many of them through different times
of the year. I will say that the BEST bike I have commuted with is an ebike with a belt drive and an
internal hub. No maintenance and you don't even have to pedal very much if you don't want.

Any bike can be used as a commuter bike. It does require a little bit of planning regardless of the
bike that is being used. I would recommend having a dedicated commuter that you also use for other
activities as opposed to an activity bike that you commute with. Reason being, if you are riding a
bike every day, you want it to be ready to go and good every day. Now, that being said, a slightly
"beefier" bike is going to be better. Hybrid bike and commuter bikes are more upright and comfortable
than race focused bike. However, the a gravel bike, mountain bike and road bike will all work. Bigger
tires will work better in snowy weather and varying terrain than smaller tires.

* Hybrid bikes - very good option, though may need to watch out for lower quality bikes.
* Mountain bikes - good all weather option, though often lack mount points for racks.
* Gravel bikes - decent all weather option, but often lack mount points for racks.
* Road bike - my least favorite option unless you are trying to be as fast as possible.

## Bike Gear

Fenders and a bike rack make commuting so much easier.
