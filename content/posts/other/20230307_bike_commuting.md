# Bike Commuting Guidelines

This is something that I have been considering putting together for a few years now. I've gone
through several iterations of it along with bike commuting for many stretches of time. The purpose
of this is to serve as a reference sheet for bike commuting in general.


## What Bike To Use

I have owned many different types of bikes and have commuted on many of them through different times
of the year. I will say that the BEST bike I have commuted with is an ebike with a belt drive and an
internal hub. No maintenance and you don't even have to pedal very much if you don't want. 

Any bike can be used as a commuter bike. It does require a little bit of planning regardless of the
bike that is being used. I would reccomend having a dedicated commuter that you also use for other 
activities as opposed to an activity bike that you commute with. Reason being, if you are riding a 
bike every day
