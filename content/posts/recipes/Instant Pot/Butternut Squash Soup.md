# Instant Pot Butternut Squash Soup

Found the initial recipe online somewhere. Have made a few times and it's pretty good. Note that at the end everything.
This may be sacrilegious to some, but don't panic if you only have a yellow onion, left over beef stock and some baby
carrots and forget to buy a bundle of spring only to waste all but one of them. It's fine. It'll taste great. 


* 2 cups vegetable stock
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 carrot, peeled and diced
* 1 Granny Smith apple, cored and diced 
* 1 medium (uncooked) butternut squash*, peeled, seeded and diced
* 1 sprig fresh sage
* 1 white onion, diced
* 1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly-ground black pepper, or more to taste
* 1/8 teaspoon cayenne, or more to taste
* pinch of ground cinnamon and nutmeg
* 1/2 cup canned (unsweetened) coconut milk
* optional garnishes: extra coconut milk and a sprinkle of smoked paprika (or cayenne pepper)

## Instructions

1. Add everything except the coconut milk and optional garnishes to the pressure cooker

 2. Manual pressure cook on high for 8 minutes
 3. Quick release pressure and wait for it so stop expelling steam
 4. Remove Lid
3. Remove and discard the sage.  Stir in the coconut milk.
4. Use immersion blender to blend.
5. Serve warm, with optional garnishes if desired.

### Notes
* 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne is quite a bit of spice.
* Honeycrisp apples will work if that's all you have. But why waste them?
* Baby carrots, full carrots, whatever.
