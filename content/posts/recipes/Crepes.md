# Crêpes

* Serves: 4
* Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients

* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 large eggs
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour and eggs. Gradually add in milk and water while stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter, then beat until smooth.

Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.j

Pour or scoop approximately 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each crêpe. Tilt the pan in a circular motion to evenly coat the surface with batter.j

Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, approximately 1 to 2 minutes.j

Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe. Flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more.j

Serve hot.
