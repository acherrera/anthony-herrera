# Easy Retro

Can use the [4 "L" Retro](https://www.teamretro.com/retrospectives/4ls-retrospective) method with easy retro to get team feedback without having to ask everyone directly.

Website is located [here](https://easyretro.io)

The 4 "L"'s are:
* Liked: what did people like about the last sprint
* Learned: What were some learnings that happened?
* Lacked: What seemed to be missing? Unclears or needed to happen. (previously missing)
* Longed For: What was something that they wish existed? (wish would exist in the future)

### Anonymization

Team members _should_ feel like they can provide feedback to everyone. However, the meeting should also be honest and open to point that team members do not feel they must hide behind anonymity.
