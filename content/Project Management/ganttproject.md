# GanttProject

Open source, free-to-use software that can be found here: [GanttProject](https://www.ganttproject.biz/).

Very lightweight and relatively Git-friendly. Data is stored in XML, so merges make sense and should be easier to manage.

## Features

- **Resource Tracking**
  - Time off tracking
  - Workload tracking
- **Project Tracking**
  - Tasks
  - Subtasks
  - Dependencies
  - "Trickle down" changes
    - One change will affect dependent tasks

## Key Terms

- **Critical Path** - Chain of dependent tasks that lead to the project being complete
  - If there are many projects in one file, this results in the critical path system not working very well.
- **PERT Chart: Project Evaluation and Review Technique**
  - This shows the paths that result from the dependent items in the project.
  - Many little projects in a single file result in this not being very useful.
