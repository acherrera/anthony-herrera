# Interesting Prints

These are things that I've printed and found interesting

#### Armadillo Lizard: 

Found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:519904o2). This is a fun print in place part. 
Notes
* Fine  and slow settings worked well
* Printing without a brim is ideal as there are a lot of little parts that you would need to cut out.

#### Filament Test Patch

Found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2953888), this is a quick and easy test piece to see how your filament looks. 
Notes
* Customize in Tinkercad to add custom text
* Fast and course is good enough

Related, [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4784783) and [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5172012) are prints to hold all your test patches
#### Ryobi 40V battery holder

Found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1595930) This is a print that hold Ryobi 40V batteries. I have quite a few of these batteries and they are starting to get out of hand. So, batter holder wall!
