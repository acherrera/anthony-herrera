# Website basics


# HTML

HTML forms one part of the website's system. Typically this is HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling and
JavaScript for complex action and interactivity

HTML is written using tags, here is a sample of what we can do.

```html
€‹<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>TryHackMe HTML Editor</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Cat Website!</h1>
            <p>See images of all my cats!</p>
            <img src='img/cat-1.jpg'>
            <img src='img/cat-2.'>
        <!-- Add dog image here -->
    </body>
</html>
```

These should be pretty familiar if you've dug around the back ends of websites for a while. Basically every tag has a
closing tag and that makes the world go round.
