# Programming

I like to program. I start learning how to program in High School. I followed some tutorials and set variables and created functions.
I did not understand the point of programming as it all went away after I would close IDLE. 
Then I discovered you could _RUN A FILE_ and not only program "interactively". This was life changing. It only took a year to realize this.
