# Scarpa Helix Climbing Shoe Review

First off, who am I? I frequently visit the gym to climb, enjoy socializing with fellow climbers, and if I can't conquer a route, I don't lose much sleep over it. In other words, I love climbing, I can lead climb, but I'm not effortlessly scaling 5.12+ routes on sight. If that resonates with you, keep reading. If not, just bear that in mind.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE these shoes. Initially, I bought a size that was slightly too big and wore them until the toe wore out. Later, I purchased the correct size, and I also adore those. These shoes aren't highly aggressive and offer ample space for my wide feet to feel comfortable.

I used these shoes extensively in Las Vegas, climbing the red rocks there. Our guide mentioned using the Helix shoes to climb El Capitan. If they were suitable for that climb, I believed they were suitable for me too.

What I like:

* The wide shoe accommodates my broad feet.
* The soft material is extremely comfortable.
* The flat design ensures continuous comfort during wear.
* The laces provide a snug fit for your feet.

What I dislike:

* Laces make putting on and taking off the shoes quickly a bit challenging.
* The lack of aggressive design sometimes feels like a limitation on extremely challenging climbs.
