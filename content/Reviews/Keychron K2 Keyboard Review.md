# Keyboard Review

This is a review of the KeyChron K2 keyboard that I have been using for the last year
and a half or so. I had originally purchased the keyboard due to its small size and
ability to connect via bluetooth. After using the keyboard for a while, I have ended up
purchasing a second KeyChron keyboard to use for both work and home.

## Pros

There are some pretty nice feature of this keyboard that makes it my go-to for work and play.

* Small form factor
* Arrow keys
* 3 bluetooth connections and one wired connection
* Switch for Mac / Windows layout
* Switch for bluetooth / wired connections
* RGB lighting (on some models)
* Multiple switch options
* Lots of color options and pattern to chose from
  
## Cons

* Lack of number pad (obviously)
* Default keys feel a bit cheap
* No insert key?
* FN keys work differently between different computers (might be a personal issues)

## Would I recommend?

Absolutely - this keyboard is fantastic. I think it really hits that "dimishing
returns" point on the cost / benefit curve. That is, you could spend a lot more money
and get only a marginally better keyboard. As a first keyboard, I've found this to be very good and would recommend for someone interested in getting into mechanical keyboards without breaking the bank.
