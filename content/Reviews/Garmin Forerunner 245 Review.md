# Garmin ForeRunner 245 Review

This is a review of the Garmin Forerunner 245 - a watch made by Garmin and this watch is built for one thing - recording
activities and  lasting for a LONG time. My wife originally purchased this watch and I liked it so much I got my own.

## Things I like

* Battery lasts for many days
* Integration into Garmin Connect (and through this, most other apps)
* Ability to view text message and do simple responses
* Heart rate, breathing, O2, sleep quality measurements

## Thing I Do Not Like

* screen is kind of plain
* no super "wow" functionality

## Would I recommend

If you want a watch that tracks activities and lasts for a long, long
time, this is definitely the watch for you. If, however, you are looking for a
flashy, brightly colored watch with cutting edge features like a microphone and a speaker to do calls, then you should probably look elsewhere.

While this watch is not completely purpose-built, it is pretty close to that category. It still has some smart watch feature while focusing squarely on those who take activity tracking seriously.
