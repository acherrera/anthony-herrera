# Breakfast Casserole 2

Not to be confused with [[Breakfast Casserole 1]]

This is the one that Jen made.

* 1 lb. breakfast sausage
* 1 red bell pepper (diced) OR spinach
* 1/4 onion, finely diced
* 2-3 cloves garlic, finely diced
* 12 eggs
* 1/2 c. milk or half and half
* salt and pepper to taste
* 2 c. shredded cheese, divided
* 1 (24-oz.) package of frozen, shredded hash browns, thawed 

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 13-by-9-inch (or other 3-quart) baking dish with butter or nonstick spray.

Cook the meat until no pink pieces remain, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the bell pepper, onion, and garlic, and cook for 3 more minutes. 

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, half and half, salt, black pepper. 

Layer the baking dish with the hash browns, meat and vegetable mixture, and 1 1/2 cups of cheese. Pour the egg mixture over the top evenly.

Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 50 minutes. Remove the foil and top with the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese. Increase the oven temperature to 400°F and finish baking until the center of the casserole is set (not jiggly) and the top is slightly golden, 10 minutes more. Let rest for several minutes before serving.
