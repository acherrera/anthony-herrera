# Chili Recipe

It's chili. It's pretty good. It's pretty fast. I like to use the instant pot for instant potting and the stove for stove stuff like to saute onions and brown beef. 



## Ingredients 

*  1/2 medium onion (chopped)
*  1 tablespoon olive oil
*  2 pounds lean ground beef
*  3 cloves garlic (minced)
*  1 (28 fluid ounce) can diced tomatoes (use fire roasted ones for more flavor)
*  1 (14 fluid ounce) can tomato sauce
* 4 oz jalepenos - hot
* 4 oz diced chilis - mild
*  1/2 cup beef broth
*  2 (14 fluid ounce) cans red kidney beans (drained)
*  3 tablespoons chili powder
*  1 tablespoon smoked paprika
*  1 teaspoon ground cumin
*  1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional - if you want it spicy)
*  Salt & pepper (to taste)
*  Garnish: avocado, scallions, sour cream, Tex-Mex cheese, cilantro, tortilla strips, etc. (optional)

### Directions

Here is how to actually make it:

1. Add the chopped onion and oil to pan and saute on stove. (Can be done in Instant Pot as well)
2. Stir in the ground beef and cook, stirring often (break it up with your spoon), until browned.
3. Combine garlic, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, beef broth, beans, chili powder, smoked paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper in Instant Pot. If cooking onions and beef separately, add those as well. ADD EVERYTHING TO THE POT . 
5. Close it up and cook on high pressure for  15 minutes.
6. Once countdown has finished, blast the pressure away.  Can also allow pressure to release naturally, but if we had patience, we wouldn't be making chili with an Instant Pot. Serve with whatever you want.
