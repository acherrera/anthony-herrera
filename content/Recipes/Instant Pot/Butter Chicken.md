# Butter Chicken

A recipe the uses a shocking amount of butter. and chicken. Therefore butter chicken.

## Notes

Put onions in to make the curry base. No one will know. It's good too. 

If putting veggies in, put them in AFTER pressure cooking. 

Carrots would be great. 

Bell peppers might be good, they have a LOT of water. Especially if put in before pressure cooking.

Simmer after cooking. Instructions are stupid, bring temperature up, boil down mixture if needed. It will thicken up as
it cools, but we don't typically serve things cold.



PREP TIME: 5 mins
COOK TIME: 20 mins
TOTAL TIME: 25 mins
SERVINGS: 4 servings + extra sauce

### INGREDIENTS
  
* 1 14- ounce Canned Tomatoes
* 5-6 cloves Garlic
* 1-2 teaspoons Minced Ginger
* 1 teaspoon Turmeric
* 1/2 teaspoons Cayenne Pepper
* 1 teaspoon Smoked Paprika
* 1 teaspoon Kosher Salt
* 1 teaspoon Garam Masala
* 1 teaspoon Ground Cumin
* 1 pound Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs (or use breast, bone-in, or whatever works for you. If frozen, add 1-2 minutes to total time)
* To finish
* 4 ounces butter cut into cubes (use coconut oil if dairy free)
* 4 ounces Heavy Cream (use full-fat coconut milk if dairy free)
* 1 teaspoon Garam Masala
* 1/4-1/2 cup chopped cilantro



## INSTRUCTIONS

## Instant Pot instructions

* Place all ingredients into an Instant Pot in the order listed, EXCEPT for the butter, cream and 1 teaspoon of the garam masala, mixing the sauce well before you place the chicken on top of the sauce. If it's frozen, push it into the sauce a bit so it defrosts better

* Close the cooker and set for 10 mins on high, and let it release pressure naturally for 10 minutes. After that, release all remaining pressure. 

* Open up the pot and remove the chicken carefully and set aside

* Blend together all the ingredients, preferably using an immersion blender

* Add the cut up butter, cream, cilantro, and garam masala and stir until well incorporated.

* It's best to let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the cream. Adding it into the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that happens, just put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon

* Take out half the sauce and freeze for later or store in the fridge for 2-3 days

* Add the chicken back in and heat through. Break it up into smaller pieces if you need but don't shred it.

* Serve over rice, or zucchini noodles


## Using leftover sauce

Use leftover cooked chicken and mix in with the gently heated sauce, let it simmer for a few for the flavors to meld together and there you go. Add some fresh cilantro on top.
You could also use this for Paneer Makhani. Defrost a cup of peas and 1 cup of paneer and mix gently into the heated sauce and let it simmer for a few for the flavors to meld together and there you go.
