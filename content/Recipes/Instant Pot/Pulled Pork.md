### Detailed Instructions 

Begin by cutting the meat into manageable cubes, approximately 3 inches on each side. This ensures easier handling and a more refined pulled pork texture.

Heat a pan to medium-high and add butter. Brown the pork cubes on each side without fully cooking them.

While the pork cubes are browning, generously season them with the chosen spices.

Transfer the browned cubes into the instant pot. If necessary, work in batches to accommodate all the pork cubes.

Deglaze the cooking pan with a bit of water, scraping off the stuck bits. Pour this flavorful mixture into the instant pot.

Add an additional cup of water to the instant pot to prevent the burn warning while the pot reaches temperature.

Seal the pot with its lid, set it for 40 minutes, and allow it to cook.

Once done, let the pot rest for 10 minutes before releasing the pressure.

Use tongs to transfer the cooked meat onto a baking sheet.

Proceed to shred the meat.

For a textured finish, place the shredded meat on the top rack of the oven and broil for 5 minutes. This helps eliminate excess moisture, preventing the meat from becoming soggy.

Store or serve your delectable creation!
