# Instant Pot Spaghetti Squash

If you would like my whole life story in addition to how to cook squash, sorry. It's not here. What is here is
instructions on how to cook squash.

## INGREDIENTS

- 1 spaghetti squash (about 3 pounds)
- 1 cup water

## INSTRUCTIONS

- Slice the spaghetti squash in half (whichever way fits best is okay) and then scoop out the seeds in the center.
    
- Place a trivet or steamer basket in the bottom of the Instant Pot and add a cup of water into the bottom. Arrange the cut squash halves on top of the trivet and secure the lid. Make sure the steam release valve in the lid is turned to the **Sealing** position.
    
- Use the **pressure cook** or **manual** button to set the pressure cooker to cook at high pressure for 7 minutes. It will take roughly 8-10 minutes for the pot to build pressure before the cooking cycle begins, so make sure to consider that extra time when planning your meal.
    
- When the timer goes off, carefully turn the steam release valve to **Venting**, to quickly release any remaining steam pressure.
    
- Check squash to ensure tenderness.
    
- Use a fork to separate the strands from each other.

- Serve with whatever you want. Refrigerate the rest.
    

## Oven

- Chop in half across the short side, scoop out innards, coat inside and edges with oil, put face down on tray with liner, put in oven at 400 for 45 min.
