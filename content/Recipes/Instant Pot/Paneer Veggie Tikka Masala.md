# Instant Pot Chicken Tikka Masala

A healthy, easy version of authentic Indian chicken tikka masala made quick in the pressure cooker. Not too spicy, ultra creamy, filled with flavor, and great leftover too!

For a less veggie-based recipe, see [[Healthy Chicken Tikka Masala]]

It's not really as buttery as authentic tikka masala and it also has lots of veggies and paneer instead of meat. 
But, it's quite a bit healthier and really, really good.
### Info
Prep: 10 mins
Cook: 50 mins
Total: 1hour
Serves: 6


### Ingredients
- 1 pound paneer cut into chunks
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter or coconut oil, ghee, or extra-virgin olive oil...I do think the butter is worth it here!_
- 1 small yellow onion finely chopped
- 3 large cloves garlic minced (about 1 tablespoon)
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon garam masala
- 1 teaspoon ground chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne (use more if you like the dish spicy)
- 1 can no salt added tomato sauce (8 ounces)
- 1 can light coconut milk (14 ounces)
- 3 cups frozen veggies
- 1/2 cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt
- Brown Rice or Naan for Serving
- Fresh cilantro for serving

### Notes

* Imersion blend diced tomatoes - surprise! Spaghetti sauce.
* Paneer will survive the pressure cooking. I was surprised. 
* This recipe has just enough liquid to set everything - I recommend heating everything is "saute" mode before sealing it and pressure cooking. This sould prevent the burn warning.
	* If burn warning occurs: Vent pressure, open lid and scrape burnt stuff off bottom. Reseal and try again.


### Instructions 

- Add the butter to an Instant Pot set to SAUTE. Once melted, add the onion, garlic, ginger, garam masala, chili powder, cumin, turmeric, and cayenne. 
- Cook, stirring often, until the onion is soft and the spices are very fragrant, about 5 minutes.
- Add the panner, stir to coat with the spices and onion, and cook, stirring often, about 4 minutes. 
- Add the tomato sauce and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir to combine and allow to heat while stirring often. 
- Cover and cook on HIGH pressure for 8 minutes. Vent to immediately release the pressure.
- Uncover and stir in the coconut milk. Transfer to stove top, add frozen veggies and bring mixture back up to simmer.
- Simmer mixture for 5-10 minutes to thicken.
- Let cool for a few minutes, and then stir in the Greek yogurt (do not stir in the Greek yogurt right away or it may curdle). Enjoy warm with rice or naan and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro.
