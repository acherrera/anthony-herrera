Very good. Could be considered only two servings if you were really, really hungry. IE: at least double it if you're having people over. 

Also note - cut up the onions really small unless you want big onion chunks.

### Instructions 

#### Making the vindaloo paste

- Start the instant pot on saute mode and add the dry whole spices – dry red kashmiri chilies, coriander seeds, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, peppercorns, cumin and mustard seeds.
- Sauté for about a minute until they are fragrant and slightly browned. Make sure the spices do not burn. Turn off the instant pot.
- Transfer the whole spices to a grinder. Add ginger, garlic, tamarind paste and vinegar. 
- Add 3/4 cup water and grind to a smooth paste. 

#### Marinating the chicken with vindaloo paste

- In a large bowl, add the chicken pieces. Add the vindaloo paste to the chicken. Mix well and refrigerate for 15 minutes to overnight.

#### Making the curry

- Start the pressure cooker in sauté mode and heat oil in it.
- Add onions and saute for about 4 minutes until they turn golden brown.
- Add turmeric and salt.Add the marinated chicken and saute for 3 minutes, while stirring frequently.
- Mix in any remaining vindaloo paste from the marinade in 1/4 cup water, and add to the instant pot. Deglaze the pot and make sure nothing is stuck to the bottom.  
- Pressure cook for 5 minutes, then do a 5 minutes NPR. This means after the pressure cooker beeps, let the pressure release naturally for 5 minutes, then do a quick release manually.  
- Add brown sugar and stir in the curry.
- Garnish with cilantro and serve hot with rice, naan or roti.
