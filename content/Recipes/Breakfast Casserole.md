Breakfast Casserole


Serves 4 pretty well

### Ingredients

- 1 lb Sausage
- 6 Eggs
- 2 cups Cheddar Cheese shredded - I like cheddar but you can use your favorite
- 1/2 package Frozen Hashbrowns 15oz
- 2 cups Milk
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper

### Directions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Crumble sausage into a skillet on the stove and brown completely. Remove from heat.
In a large bowl, mix eggs and milk together and whisk well.

Add salt and pepper to this mixture and stir.
To a 9x13 dish, add frozen hashbrowns, sausage, and cheese - stir together in the dish

Pour the egg/milk mixture into the dish.

Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes - covered with foil. Remove the foil and bake for about 10-15 minutes more until the dish is bubbly and cheese is melted.


### Notes

Frozen potatoes in casserole is stupid. Cook that in a pan, get a good sear and put it at the bottom of that pan. When almost done, cook some more and put in top after tin foil is removed. 

Diced onion sauteed. Bell peppers and some garlic. Come on people. Mix that in the egg mixture and you're good to go.

Cook time of 50 minutes total (30/20) worked perfectly
