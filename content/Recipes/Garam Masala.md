EQUIPMENT
* Coffee Grinder
* COLLAPSIBLE SILICONE FUNNEL
* STAINLESS STEEL MEASURING CUPS
* OVAL MEASURING SPOONS

INGREDIENTS
  
 * 2 tablespoons Coriander Seeds
 * 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
 * 1/2 teaspoon Whole Cloves
 * 1/2 teaspoon Cardamom Seeds
 * 2 Bay Leaves
 * 3 Dried Red Chilis (the kind you put on pizza)

# INSTRUCTIONS

Put all ingredients into a clean coffee grinder and grind until it's a coarse-fine powder.

Shake it about as its being ground so all the seeds and bits get under the blades.

When you're finished, unplug the grinder, and turn it upside down.

You want all the spice to collect into the lid so you can easily scoop it out without cutting yourself playing about around the blades.

Finished! Use in the palak paneer recipe I have posted as well as the chicken curry recipe.
