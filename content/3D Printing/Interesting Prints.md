# Interesting Prints

These are things that I've printed and found interesting


# Baking Recipes
#### Armadillo Lizard: 

Found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:519904o2). This is a fun print in place part. 
Notes
* Fine  and slow settings worked well
* Printing without a brim is ideal as there are a lot of little parts that you would need to cut out.

#### Filament Test Patch

Found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2953888), this is a quick and easy test piece to see how your filament looks. 
Notes
* Customize in Tinkercad to add custom text
* Fast and course is good enough

Related, [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4784783) and [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5172012) are prints to hold all your test patches
#### Ryobi 40V battery holder

Found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1595930) This is a print that hold Ryobi 40V batteries. I have quite a few of these batteries and they are starting to get out of hand. So, batter holder wall!

#### Can Dispenser

[Link](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5905359) - I printed off the 6 can version of this and put it together and discovered that cans can be different sizes in different countries. Which led to [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5419326) expansion print and everything was good.

#### Bike Brake Space

[link](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2140945) This one is a little niche - these fit into the calipers of mountain bike brakes and keep the brake pads separated. These are very useful when transporting bikes as having the pads touch can cause issues. At very least it's a pain to try and separate them.
