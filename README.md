# Herrera Labs

This is the code for the website that I hope to get started. This is built off Python and Pelican which will allow me to
create a static website.

## Running The Website


## Dev Notes

Run the website with this: 

```
pelican content -s pelicanconf.py -t ./themes/notmyidea/ -r -l
```

### 20230124 - First Starting

Created the first steps and started to look into how to intgrate Google Analytics into the website. Appears that I will
need to use a theme. Because of this, copied the theme `simple` to the template directory.
