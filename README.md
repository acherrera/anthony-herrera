# DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY!!

This is a duplicate of the files that are stored in my person note taking system. How to edit (for me):

1. Edit in the "Pandora" Obisidan vault
2. Copy file to the corresponding location in this repo
3. Commit and push - watch it deploy successfully (hopefully)

For anyone else, if you want to add something, please reach out. I don't know why other _would_ want to 
add something, but hey, why not?


# Test locally 

```bash
npx quartz build --serve
```
